	<h2>Golf!</h2>
	<p>Since I was a young child golf had always intrigued me. My babysitters son introduced me to the game when I was 7/8 however it wasn't until 2014 til I first joined a golf club.
            In 2014 I joined Mahon Golf Club, 2 years later I found myself playing in Cork Golf Club, Little Island. You can get a greater insight 
            into the course/club by following<a href="https://www.corkgolfclub.ie/"> this link.</a>

		The game of golf has taught me respect, composure and appreciation. I feel priveledged to be able to walk the lucious green fairways on any given hazy summer evenings, the beauty of the course is indescribable and inescapable.

		Both triumph and defeat are omnipresent in the game of golf, but enjoyment is at the epicentre of it all. Being able to get a couple hours a week to walk the peaceful course grounds gives 
                alot of time for thought and benefits the individual undoubtedly. If you would like to see more about the benefits of the game of golf,
