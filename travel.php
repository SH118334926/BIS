	<h2>Travel</h2>
	<p>I first left the country when I was a baby on a family holiday to Lanzarote however I was much too young to remember. 
            In my 19 years of living I am yet to leave the continent of Europe but have visited 5 different countries multiple times. </p>

	<p> My favorite country which I have been to is Holland. I first went on a school tour in transition year and returned this January with a group of my friends. 
            Although infamous for certain legal 'illegal' activities, Holland is a beautiful country. The people, infrastructure, archictecture, history of the country
            are all to be explored and enjoyed. Italy and France are countries I've returned to on multiple occasions, both brilliant places to travel to hence the multiple trips.
	</p>
	<p>
            In the future I hope to travel Asia, visiting countries such as Japand and Thailand. As regards plans, nothing is set in stone yet but living in Holland/abroad
            for a few years is an idea I've always entertained. 
            Travel is an experience, not only is it ejoyable but often lead to great learning experience.
